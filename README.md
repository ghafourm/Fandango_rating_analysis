# Fandango_rating_analysis
Comparison of Fandango site scores over time and with other rating sites

This is one of Dataquest Python guided projets
In this analysis we compared the changes in Fandango (movie rating site) user score in 2015 and 2016.
We compared also Fandabgo's score with 3 other sites, imdb, metacritics and rotten tomatoes, in 2015 and 2016.
The main question is about a bias in Fandango's user rating and wether this bias remains over time.

The data is publicly available on GitHub: https://github.com/mircealex/Movie_ratings_2016_17
